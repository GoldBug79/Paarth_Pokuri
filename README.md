End-to-End Image Segmentation & Object Tracking Pipeline
This repository contains the completed technical assessment for the Labellerr Computer Vision Internship, submitted by Gurnoor Kaur. It demonstrates a full-stack, end-to-end machine learning workflow, covering the entire lifecycle from data acquisition and annotation to model training, evaluation, and deployment for a real-world tracking application.

🚀 Project Overview
The core objective of this project was to build a robust system capable of performing instance segmentation and multi-object tracking on videos, specifically focusing on vehicles and pedestrians. The pipeline simulates a real-world MLOps cycle, showcasing a deep understanding of modern computer vision tools and best practices.

Tech Stack:

Annotation Platform: Labellerr

Segmentation Model: YOLOv8-Seg (Ultralytics)

Tracking Algorithm: ByteTrack

Environment: Google Colab (GPU), Python

Key Features:

Data-Centric Approach: Utilized the Labellerr platform for precise data annotation, forming the foundation of the model's performance.

Advanced Deep Learning: Fine-tuned a state-of-the-art YOLOv8-Seg model for accurate instance segmentation.

High-Performance Tracking: Integrated the trained model with ByteTrack to maintain consistent object identities across video frames, even through occlusions.

Reproducible Workflow: The entire process is encapsulated in a Google Colab notebook, ensuring full reproducibility.

🛠️ E2E Workflow & Methodology
The project was executed through a structured, multi-stage pipeline.

1. Data Acquisition and Preparation
A dataset of traffic images was sourced from Kaggle. A subset of 150 images was curated, with 100 designated for training and 50 for a hold-out test set to ensure unbiased evaluation. This initial step involved cleaning the dataset to retain only relevant images.

2. Data Annotation on Labellerr
A project was created on the Labellerr platform, and the 100 training images were uploaded. Using Labellerr's advanced annotation tools, precise polygon masks were drawn for all instances of the Vehicle and Pedestrian classes. After annotation, the labels were exported in the COCO JSON format.

3. Model Training: YOLOv8-Seg
A Python script converted the exported COCO annotations into the YOLOv8-Seg label format required for training. A crucial debugging step was performed during this stage to resolve an issue with class index mapping. The dataset was then split into an 80/20 train/validation ratio. A pre-trained yolov8s-seg.pt model was fine-tuned on this custom dataset for 100 epochs, with performance metrics logged throughout.

4. Model Evaluation & Inference
The model's performance was evaluated using standard metrics on the validation set. The final trained model was then used to run inference on the 50 unseen test images, generating high-quality segmentation masks.

5. Tracking with ByteTrack
The trained YOLOv8-Seg model was integrated as the primary detector for the ByteTrack algorithm. A video was created from the test images, and the pipeline processed it frame-by-frame. ByteTrack's association logic successfully tracked individual objects, assigning them consistent IDs. The final output is an annotated video and a results.json file containing detailed tracking data.

📊 Results & Performance
The YOLOv8-Seg model demonstrated strong performance after 100 epochs of training. The key metrics on the validation set are:

Box Detection (mAP50-95(B)): 0.733

Mask Segmentation (mAP50-95(M)): 0.514

These results indicate that the model is not only effective at accurately locating objects (box detection) but also at defining their precise boundaries (segmentation). The final tracking video showcases this performance in a dynamic, real-world application.
